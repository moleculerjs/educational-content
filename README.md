## What is this?

Moleculer community program is a way to show and share your technical skills while helping other Moleculer users.

## How it works?

It's simple:

1. Head to the [Repository Issues](https://github.com/moleculerjs/educational-content/issues) and look for a topic that you're interesting in. Keep in mind that you can also propose a new topic for an article/tutorial.

2. Select a topic that you would like to work on and state your interest in it. A simple `I'm interested in this topic.` is enough.

3. Be assigned to the topic that you've selected.

4. Follow the [Guide](.github\ISSUE_TEMPLATE\writing-an-article.md) when writing the tutorial.

5. Send us a draft for a review. We use [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/)

6. Wait until the approval and get paid :moneybag:

## What do I get in return?

As mentioned, you will get paid for each article/tutorial that you create. However, that's not all... `ToDo`
