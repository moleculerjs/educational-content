## What is this?

Moleculer community program is a way to show and share your technical skills while helping other Moleculer users.

## How does it work?

It's simple:

1. Head to the [Repository Issues](https://github.com/moleculerjs/educational-content/issues) and look for a topic that you're interesting in. Keep in mind that you can also propose a new topic for an article/tutorial.

2. Select a topic that you would like to work on and state your interest in it. A simple `I'm interested in this topic.` is enough.

3. Be assigned to the topic that you've selected.

4. Follow the [Guide](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/writing-an-article.md) when writing the tutorial.

5. Send us a draft for a review. We use [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/)

6. Wait until the approval and get paid :moneybag:

## What do I get in return?

As mentioned, you will get paid for each article/tutorial that you create. Moreover, by putting your knowledge in words you'll improve your communication skills and improve your [knowledge retention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_pyramid). Don't forget that it's pretty cool to be know as the smart person that is always available to help and share their expertise.

## How do I get paid? 
After your article/tutorial is approved we will send you the money via PayPal. The price depends on the quality of the article but we follow the following criteria:
- Less than 1000 words: 25 - 75 USD
- More than 1000 words: 50 - 150 USD
